# Web Hosting 101
Infrastructure of the Web
  

<small>Elly Post, Loyola University Chicago</small>

## Outline

* The file protocol
* What is hosting?
* HTTP intro
* Simple servers
* How do I use hosting?
* Static site options
* Security concerns
* Docker & Containerized Development

---
## The <code>file://</code> protocol

* Up until now, you've accessed your web app files using the file protocol or by running a server implicitly through your IDE
* This is a protocol built into your OS that allows basic reading of HTML files
* The web does _not_ use the file protocol
      * rather, it uses HTTP, which requires a server

---
## What is "Web Hosting"?

* Paid service to store (host) files (applications) on a remote computer (server)
* Various protocols exist to access the files
  * Upload and download protocols
* HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, FTPES, SFTP, SCP, SSH, rsync, samba, etc.
* Essentially, you rent a web server to _serve_ your web application to visitors

## Web Hosting Diagram

<img src="https://www.abetterhostingservice.com/the-how-to-in-web-hosting.gif" style="width: 90%; display: block; margin: 10px auto; height: auto">

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.abetterhostingservice.com/company.html">https://www.abetterhostingservice.com/company.html</a></p>

* Look at `traceroute` for example path finding

---
## HTTP(S) Intro

--
* **H**yper **T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol 
--

* Most common protocol for accessing web applications
  * Common alternative: UDP (Good for acceptable packet loss)
* Based on TCP/IP
  * Tim Berners-Lee, once again
* Powers what we think of as the web
* Can send any data (text, media, etc.) between two machines provided both can understand HTTP
* Has methods, a head, a body, status codes, and uses packets
* HTTPS uses TLS/SSL to encrypt the HTTP packet body

---
## Servers 101

* Local host vs remote host
* LAMP stack
  * XAMP, MAMP, WAMP, Bitnami
* Simple vs complex servers

---
## Simple Servers

* Not intended for production sites
--

* Very insecure, unstable (scalability wise)
--

* Often not bundled with common services like database connections
--

* Almost always disabled to connecting to from the web
--

* Easy to set up a _simple_ server on your machine
--

* When running locally, you access through _localhost_
  * http://localhost
  * http://::1
  * http://127.0.0.1 (there's no place like 127.0.0.1)
--

* Default ports:
  * HTTP: 80 or 8080
  * HTTPS: 443
  * FTP/FTPES/FTPS: 21
  * SFTP/SSH/SCP: 22 or 2222

---
## Simple Servers

* Python, node, PHP, and many other langauges all offer simple servers
* Most Macs and Linux machines come with at least one of those languages/tools pre-installed
* Consult the docs for any given language on how to create a simple server
* Python2 Example:
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```
* Python3 Example:
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

---
## Remote Hosting (Web Hosting)

* Access through IP address or domain
  * Domain gets converted to IP address, see earlier diagram
* Many options exist for web hosting
  * Important to choose the right product
  * What needs do you have?
      * database, scalability, security, analytics, pricing, server software & OS
      * upload &amp; connection options
          * ssh, ftp, etc.

---
## Sample Web Hosts

### Recommended 

* AWS S3/EC2, etc
* Pantheon (WordPress & Drupal only)
* Digital Ocean
* A2 Hosting
* Liquid Web

### Not Recommended

* GoDaddy/BlueHost
* DreamHost
* 1&amp;1
* Wix
* Weebly

---
## SaaS, PaaS, IaaS

* SaaS
  * Software as a Service
  * Example: Google Docs, Facebook, GMail, GitHub
  * Basically: most web apps
--

* PaaS
  * Platform as a Service
  * Example: Heroku, GitHub
--

* IaaS
  * Infrastructure as a Service
  * Example: AWS, Google Drive, Dropbox

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

* Every programmer should know about AWS
* AWS powers a huge portion of the web
* Services ranging from simple storage services (S3), to content delivery networks (CDN - CloudFront), to virtual private servers (VPS - EC2), and more.
* Netflix is powered by AWS, for instance
* Free 1 year trial, worth exploring
* Google has competing network called Google Cloud Services

---
## Static Site Options

* Very easy to host a static site
  * what makes a site static, vs dynamic
* S3 or Heroku are great options for _static_ sites
  * Heroku is _PaaS_
  * S3 is _PaaS_ but AWS itself is _IaaS_
* Heroku is also excellent for dynamic sites
  * S3 primary function is static asset storage/delivery
* GitHub pages for very simple static sites

---
## Deploying with Git

* Deploying
  * to make live your website by sending it to your web host
  * Available to the world through HTTP(S)
* Heroku uses git to deploy applications
* Other automated services 
  * TravisCI
  * Jenkins
  * BitBucket Pipelines
* Alternatives exists, such as (S)FTP

---
## Git security

* Do not ever store passwords or other sensitive data such as credentials in git
* Bad practice to track those files, especially if they are stored in public repository or published to web
* Use _.env_ files and _.gitignore_

---
## Containers

* Additionally Docker is an excellent choice to _containerize_ your application
* Like the JVM it's built to work on any machine where Docker can be installed
* Good for development and production
* Kind of complex to get started, but there are options to simplify it
* [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/), [Lando](https://lando.dev/), etc
